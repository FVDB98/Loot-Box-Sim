                        <p>What is a loot box?</p>
                        <p>In video games, a loot box (also called a loot crate or prize crate) is 
                            a consumable virtual item which can be redeemed to receive a <span>randomised</span> 
                            selection of further virtual items, or loot, ranging from simple customization 
                            options for a player's avatar or character to game-changing equipment such as 
                            weapons and armor. A loot box is typically <span>a form of monetisation</span>, with players 
                            either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later 
                            <span>buying "keys"</span> with which to redeem them.</p>

                        <h2><i class="fa-regular fa-hand fa-bounce"></i> Why...</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of this website is to show the reality of loot boxes, and highlight to 
                            players how <span>unlikely</span> they will be to unlock the items they most desire. By
                            showing just how much money one would have to spend to <span>hopefully</span> unlock certain
                            items, the aim is to make players aware of how far their money will go - whether it's 
                            $10, $100, $1000, or even $10,000. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Not all loot box systems are bad, but <span>some are predatory</span> and the ability for 
                            children to spend large sums of money on mechanics that are illustrative of gambling is 
                            concerning.

                        <p>In recent affairs, companies like EA have been required to disclose the probability of unlocking certain
                            items. Using these published numbers I have used javascript to create a basic simulator to unlock 
                            items. To reinforce, <span>these simulators are in no way 100% accurate.</span> They are mererly a tool for 
                            players and outsiders to gain <span>perspective</span>.
